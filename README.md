# Hi there, I'm David Unoks 👋

### 🚀 AI Engineer & Autonomous Systems Architect

I am an AI Engineer with **3 years of experience** building production-grade ML systems. My focus is on **Vision-First Architectures**, replacing legacy OCR pipelines with Multimodal LLMs (Gemini/GPT-4V) to achieve near-100% accuracy in unstructured data extraction.

Currently building **Agentic Workflows** that automate complex business processes.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **AI/LLM:** Gemini 2.5 Flash, OpenAI API, LangChain, RAG Systems.
* **Computer Vision:** Vision-First Pipelines, OpenCV, YOLO.
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Docker, Microservices.
* **Deployment:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP), CI/CD, Streamlit.

### 🔭 Featured Project: Supermarket Autonomous Agent
* **The Challenge:** Extracting structured pricing data from "noisy" supermarket flyers where traditional Tesseract OCR failed ( < 40% accuracy).
* **The Solution:** Architected a **Vision-First Pipeline** using Gemini 2.5 Flash Multimodal.
* **The Result:** Achieved **100% accuracy** on price/unit extraction, solving complex edge cases (Red Bubble prices, hollow fonts, and layout shifts).
* **Tech:** Python, Google Gemini Vision, Streamlit, AsyncIO.

### ⚡ What I'm working on now
* Scaling single-instance inference to **Batch Processing Microservices** using Docker and Message Queues (RabbitMQ).
* Optimizing LLM token usage for high-volume data extraction.
